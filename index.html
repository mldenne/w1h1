  <h2>Flavors so awful they will make you cry!</h2>
  <div class="flavors">
    <p class="flavorsdescript">This ice cream is for those with no taste buds or without any taste whatsoever! Great for gag gifts or for gagging in general.</p>
    <p>How did we get started? Something happened in college. Had to do with beer and an ice cream social. No one really remembers much.</p>
    <p>We will ship to any location as long as you are willing to pay for it and as long as the dry ice stays dry (we don't recommend sending to the equator).  Take a look around and see what appeals, or rather does not appeal, to you!</p>

          <td>Only found in Toyko's indoor amusement park, Namja Town, this delicacy is for those with more cannibalistic taste buds. It's brownish red color, putrid smell (especially if it is left in the freezer for a month or so), and even weirder texture will assuredly turn the most avid meat eater into a vegan!</th>

One lick will clear out the sinuses, two will cause serious digestive problems, and three...well, we don't personally know anyone who has made it to three...</th>

          <td>Ice cream that tastes like the sea! It would be really irresponsible if we didn't include an ice cream that tastes like smell of the sea on a hot, humid, stinking summer day. Fun to serve to children who think they are getting a bowl of strawberry ice cream.  The look on their faces when that first bite hits their tongue? Priceless.</th>
