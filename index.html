      <h2>...for the most awful flavors of ice cream ever...</h2>
      <p>This ice cream is for those with no taste buds or without any taste whatsoever! Great for gag gifts or for gagging in general.  We will ship to any location as long as you are willing to pay for it and as long as the dry ice stays dry (we don't recommend sending to the equator).  Take a look around and see what appeals, or rather does not appeal, to you!</p>

          <th>Only found in Toyko's indoor amusement park, Namja Town, this delicacy is for those with more cannibalistic taste buds. It's brownish red color, putrid smell (especially if it is left in the freezer for a month or so), and even weirder texture will assuredly turn the most avid meat eater into a vegan!</th>

          <th>Looks just like pistachio but will like your insides on fire! This ice cream is great to send as a gift for those people in your life who you really don't like...seriously. One lick will clear out the sinuses, two will cause serious digestive problems, and three...well, we don't personally know anyone who has made it to three...</th>

          <th>Ice cream that tastes like the sea! It would be really irresponsible if we didn't include an ice cream that tastes like smell of the sea on a hot, humid, stinking summer day. Fun to serve to children who think they are getting a bowl of strawberry ice cream.  The look on their faces when that first bite hits their tongue? Priceless.</th>
